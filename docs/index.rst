In this article, we'll show you all you need to know about logging into your Dashlane account, from the usual steps to follow to fix problems and access it on many devices.

How to Use Dashlane Login
Dashlane makes it easy to log in, but also has a lot of security features to keep your information safe. You only need to remember one password: the master password you selected when you made your account. Dashlane has a zero-knowledge architecture, which means they can't see or get your master password.

Your login information is never saved in plain text. They are encrypted on your device, and you are the only one who can decrypt them.

How to Get into Dashlane
To go to your Dashlane account, follow these simple steps:

From a web browser: Open the web browser you like best.

Go to the real Dashlane website.

In the top right corner, click "Log In."

Type in the email address you signed up with.

Enter your master password and click "Next."

If two-factor authentication (2FA) is turned on, do it.

You're in! You may now get to your secure vault and the information you saved.

To use the Mobile App, open the Dashlane app on your Android or iOS device.

Type in the email address for your account.

Enter your master password or use your fingerprint or Face ID.

If 2FA is turned on, use it to verify.

You will be logged in and able to use the credentials you saved.

Log in Using biometrics to log in
With Dashlane, users can log in quickly and safely via biometric login. You can set up fingerprint or facial recognition on select browsers and mobile devices.

To make it work:

Open the settings for your Dashlane account.

Under Security, turn on biometric login.

Follow the steps that are unique to your device.

This choice speeds up daily use while keeping your account safe.

Login with Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)
If you have two-factor authentication (2FA) turned on, Dashlane will ask for a code that you can only use once after you enter your master password. Apps like Google Authenticator make this code, or it is sent to your trusted device.

To log in with 2FA:

Start your authenticator app.

Type in the code that the app shows you.

Go to your account.

This gives your sensitive information another layer of safety.

Having trouble logging in? What to Do
You might have trouble logging into your Dashlane account from time to time. Here are some common situations and what you can do about them:

1. Forgot the master password
Unfortunately, Dashlane can't help you reset your master password because of how it works.

You can only try to get your account back if you set up account recovery options ahead of time.

You will have to reset the account and start over if not.

2. Device Not Found
When you log in from a new device, Dashlane may require you to do something extra to prove who you are.

Look in your email or on a trusted device for information on how to verify.

3. Problems with two-factor authentication
If you can't get to your authenticator app, use the backup recovery codes.

If you can still get into your account from another device, you can also reset 2FA.

How to Use Dashlane on More Than One Device
You can use Dashlane on more than one device. You may sign in on your tablet, phone, and computer. Just make sure you're using the same login information and that synchronization is set on.

When you sign in on a new device:

Dashlane could send you an email to confirm.

To check the device, click the link in the email.

Use your master password and 2FA to log in like you always do.

How to Keep Your Login Safe
Dashlane makes it easy to log in, but there are things you can do to make your account extra safer:

Make sure your master password is long, unique, and has a combination of letters, numbers, and symbols.

Turn on two-factor authentication. This keeps you safe even if someone gets your master password.

When you log in, don't use public Wi-Fi. If you have to, use a VPN.

When you're done using shared devices, log out.

Set up biometric login so you can get in quickly and safely.
